# Bounded Contexts of the Method

| Context | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| Governance | Decisions and system constraints |
| Workflow | Git flow, PR validation, Fast-Lanes |
| AI Interaction | Prompts and AI restrictions |
| UX Governance | UI/UX design-to-spec |

Contexts must not redefine each other's authority.
