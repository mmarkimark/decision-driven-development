# Documentation Synchronization Rule

Whenever governance or structural changes are introduced, documentation must be synchronized.

Artifacts that must be updated when applicable:

- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- GLOSSARY.md

## Rule

If a Pull Request introduces:

- new governance concepts
- new terminology
- new rules
- new processes
- new system flows

then documentation updates must be included in the same Pull Request.

A PR that modifies governance without documentation updates is incomplete.

This applies to humans and AI agents.

## Purpose

Prevents divergence between the system model and its documentation.
