# System Invariants

These are conditions that must always remain true.

- Accepted Decisions are immutable.
- No code change may occur without a governing artifact (Decision, Use Case, or Fast-Lane).
- Domain authority cannot be bypassed.
- Fast-Lanes cannot redefine architecture.
- AI agents cannot act without traceability.
- The methodology cannot evolve implicitly.

Violation of an invariant indicates governance failure.
