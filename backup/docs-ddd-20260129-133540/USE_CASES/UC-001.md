# [UC-001] Create a Decision Record

*   **Status**: Approved
*   **Derived From**: [DR-001] Adopt Decision-Driven Development
*   **Primary Actor**: Human Architect / AI Scribe

## Description
The process of creating, documenting, and finalizing a new Decision Record (DR) to propose a change to the system or process.

## Pre-conditions
*   A problem or opportunity has been identified.
*   The actor has read `DECISIONS/README.md`.

## Flow of Events
1.  Actor copies `DECISIONS/TEMPLATE.md` to `DECISIONS/DR-XXXX-title.md`.
2.  Actor assigns the next available sequential number (e.g., `DR-005`).
3.  Actor fills in the "Context" (the Why).
4.  Actor fills in the "Decision" (the What).
5.  Actor lists "Consequences" (Pros/Cons).
6.  Actor submits a Pull Request with the new file.
7.  Reviewers discuss and request changes.
8.  Once agreed, the status is set to "Accepted".
9.  PR is merged.

## Post-conditions
*   A new immutable Decision Record exists in the `DECISIONS/` directory.
*   The decision is now binding law for the project.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
*   **Clarity**: The decision must be understood by someone not involved in the discussion.
*   **Immutability**: The file name and ID must never change after merge.

## Edge Cases
*   **Rejection**: If the PR is rejected, the file is not merged (or merged with Status: Rejected for historical record, though usually just closed).
*   **Superseding**: If this decision replaces an old one, the old DR must be updated to say `Superseded By: [DR-XXXX]`.

## Verification Plan
*   [ ] Manual Verification: Check that `DECISIONS/DR-001.md` exists and follows the format.
